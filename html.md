## Creaing Your Website
- Every website should be designed for the target audience, it is important to understand who your target audience is.
- **Examples for individuals:** What is the age range? Appeal to women or men? What country do your visitors live in, in that country is it urban or rural?
- **Examples for Companies:** What is the size of the company or department? Position of people who will visit the site?
## Why They Visit
- **Questions to ask:** Discover their motivations for coming to the site and the specific goals of the visitors
- **Goals:** are they visiting for entertainment or for personal reasons
- **Achieve:** You will not always be able to list every reason why people visit your site but look for key tasks and motivations. Create a list of why people would be coming to your site.
## Info Visitors Need
- Will the visitors be familiar with your area/brand or do you need to introduce these ideas?
- Are they familiar with the product/service/info you are covering?
- What are the most important features?
- What is special about your website that sets it apart?
## Site Visitation
- Some sites will need to be updated more frequently than others. Some info is constantly changing, while others remain static.
- Based on the services of your website, that will determine that amount of time it needs to be updated. Is it a service they'll buy rarely or is it something that is changing daily? news, fashion, etc.
# Site Maps
- the aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This will show how the pages are grouped.
- **Card Sorting:** placing each bit of info that a visitor might need to know on a seperate piece of paper and organizing the related info into groups. Each group relates to a page, on larger sites the pages can be grouped together to create different sections. A site map will typically begin with the homepage. If the site itself is large, it might require it's own section homepage to link to all of the info within it.
- **Wireframes:** are a simple sketch of the key info that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy and space it will require. By creating a wireframe you can ensure that all of the info that needs to be on a page is included. 
# Using Design
- **Content:** logo, links to navigate the site, links to related articles or content, login or membership options, copyright info, links to policies, terms and conditions. With all of this, you need to organize and prioritize the info to help the users understaynd what they're looking for.
- **Prioritizing:** designers will focus on what we want to draw attention away from. Create something known as _visual hierarchy_ to help users focus on the key messages.
- **Organizing:** grouping together related content into _blocks_ or _chunks_ makes the page look simpler. 
# Visual Hierarchy
refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. 
- **Size:** larger elements will grab users' attention first
- **Color:** foreground and background color can draw attention to key messages. 
- **Style:** an element may be the same size and color as surrounding content but have a different style applied.
# HTML5
- the new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of differnt parts of a web page and help to describe it's structure.
- new elements provide clearer code, as compared with using multiple div elements
- older browsers do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
-To make HTML5 elements work in internet explorer 8 and older versions of IE, extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from google.
