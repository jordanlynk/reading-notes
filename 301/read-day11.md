## Using the API
- Volumes search by sending a "GET" request using: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=search+terms
- This request has a single parameter that is required:
- *q* - Search for volumes that contain this text string. There are special keywords you can specify in the search terms to search in particular fields, such as:
- *intitle*: Returns results where the text following this keyword is found in the title.
- *inauthor*: Returns results where the text following this keyword is found in the author.
- *inpublisher*: Returns results where the text following this keyword is found in the publisher.
- *subject*: Returns results where the text following this keyword is listed in the category list of the volume.
- *isbn*: Returns results where the text following this keyword is the ISBN number.
- *lccn*: Returns results where the text following this keyword is the Library of Congress Control Number.
- *oclc*: Returns results where the text following this keyword is the Online Computer Library Center number.
## Request:
- Ex: GET *https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=flowers+inauthor:keyes&key=yourAPIKey*
- *Response*: If this request succeeds, the server will respond with a "200 ok" HTTP status code and then the results.
- In addition to the *standard query parameters* you can use the following query parameters when performing a volumes search:
- *download* parameter restricts the returned results to volumes that have an available download format of "epub" by setting it to the value of "epub"
- *Filtering*: this parameter restricts the returned results further by setting it the to one of the following:
- *partial* - Returns results where at least parts of the text are previewable.
- *full* - Only returns results where all of the text is viewable.
- *free-ebooks* - Only returns results that are free Google eBooks.
- *paid-ebooks* - Only returns results that are Google eBooks with a price.
- *ebooks* - Only returns results that are Google eBooks, paid or free. Examples of non-eBooks would be publisher content that is available in limited preview and not for sale, or magazines.
- *Pagination*: you can paginate the volumes list by specifying two values in the parameters for the request.
- *startIndex* - The position in the collection at which to start. The index of the first item is 0.
- *maxResults* - The maximum number of results to return. The default is 10, and the maximum allowable value is 40.
- *Print Type*: you can use this parameter to restrict the returned results to a specific print or publication type by setting it to the one of the following:
- *all* - Does not restrict by print type (default).
- *books* - Returns only results that are books.
- *magazines* - Returns results that are magazines.
- *Projection*: specify a predefined set of volumes fields to return:
- *full* - Returns all Volume fields.
- *lite* - Returns only certain fields. See field descriptions marked with double asterisks in the Volume reference to find out which fields are included.
- *Sorting*: By default, a volumes search request returns maxResults results, where maxResults is the parameter used in pagination (above), ordered by relevance to search terms.
- *relevance* - Returns results in order of the relevance of search terms (this is the default).
- *newest* - Returns results in order of most recently to least recently published.
- *Retrieving a specific volume*: replace the volumeId path parameter with the ID of the volume to retrieve
