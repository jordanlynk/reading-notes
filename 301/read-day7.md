# What Google Learned About Teams

### Project Aristotle
- Google set out to determine why some of its groups were very successful while others stumbled
- Assembled a team of statisticians, organizational psychologists, sociologists, and engineers
- The only pattern that emerged was the idea that group norms had a significant impact on group performance
- Beneficial group norms
- All members speak roughly the same amount
- Members on average also had higher "average social sensitivity"
- Having clear goals and creating a culture of dependabilityOther traits of successful teams
- In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. Profitability increases when workers are persuaded to collaborate more. 
- Throughout this project, the groups vary in terms of who they are composed of, what they bring to the table and how they implemented their different styles.
- (pulled from article to refer to above sentence) Some groups said that teammates interrupted one another constantly and that team leaders reinforced that behavior by interrupting others themselves. On other teams, leaders enforced conversational order, and when someone cut off a teammate, group members would politely ask everyone to wait his or her turn. Some teams celebrated birthdays and began each meeting with informal chitchat about weekend plans. Other groups got right to business and discouraged gossip. There were teams that contained outsize personalities who hewed to their group’s sedate norms, and others in which introverts came out of their shells as soon as meetings began.
- Researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.

### How I explained REST to my brother
- *Roy Fielding*; helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet, then proceeded to do a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.
- The web, also "HTTP" first tells the browser what protocol to use. All of the stuff you in type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing. It is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It is the literal foundation of the web, think of it like a GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.
- The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called "REST". REST provides a definition of a "resource", which is what those things point to.
- A web page is a "representation" of a resource. Resources are just concepts, URLS. URLS tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.
- Other types of representation: It doesn't get used a lot, in most cases a resource has only a single representation. 
- Concepts also known as "Web Services" or "APIs". It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do.
- Computers can use same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other.
