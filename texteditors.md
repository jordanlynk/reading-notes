# Text Editors
Text editors are a piece of software that can either be downloaded and used on your computer or used through your web broswer. Text editors allow you to write and manage text, especially when used to build a website. When you're thinking about text editors and choosing the right one, it can almost seem somewhat daunting. There is no right or wrong in terms of what you decide to pick. Ultimatety, it's dealers choice.
## Features To Look For When Choosing
- **Code Completion:** allows you to start typing and will suggest an option based on what you're typing. Some code completion will close tags or brackets. Within code completion, there is also a program called "Emmet" who will help speed up your code writing. Some text editors come with it built in, although you can download it as well.
- **Syntax:** takes your normal text and colorizes it to make it more noticeable.  
- **Themes For Your Website:** these allow you to change the color of your text editor's background and the series of color in your text. Typically developers will use darker backgrounds and brightly colored text. Since you will be using the text editor quite a bit, it is better to find one that causes less eye strain and fatigue long term.

When considering which specific text editor to use, always consider your operating system and how it will function with said text editor. Some cost money, others are only specific to mac, windows, linux. Even though some are "free", it doesn't mean they aren't just as good as the ones that cost money.
