# Booleans

- == is equal to
- != is not equal to 
- === strict equal to
- !== strict not equal to
- > greater than
- >= greater than or equal to
- < less than
- <= checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right 

## Logical Operators
- Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
- && logical and; this operator tests more than one condition. If both expressions evaluate to true than the expression returns to true. If just one of these returns false, then the expression will return false.
true && true return true
true && false return false
false && true return false
false && false return false
- | | logical or; tests at least one condition. If either expression evaluates to true, then the expression returns true. If both return false, then the expression will return false.

- ! Logical Not; this operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it. This reverses the state of an expression. If it was false (without the ! before it) it would return true. If the statement was true, it would return false.
- Logical Expressions are evaluated left to right. If the first condition can provide enough info to get the answer, then there is no need to evaluate the second condition.

## Loops
- Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. There are three types of common loops:
- For; if you need to run code a specific # of times, use a _for_ loop. In a _for_ loop, the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run.
- While; If you do know how many times the code should run, you can use a _while_ loop. The condition can be something other than a counter to loop for as long as the condition is true.
-Do While; It will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.
