# Intro & Scripts

- How JavaScript makes web pages more interactive
- access content, modify content, program rules, react to events
- JS encompasses many of the traditional rules of programming. It can make the web page feel interactive by responding to what the user does.
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.

## What is a script?

- A script is a series of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step.
- A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page.
- Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation.
## Writing A Script:
- to write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
- Break down your big picture into what you want to achieve, break that down into smaller steps.
- 1.) Define the goal; once you know the goal of your script, you can work out the individual tasks needed to achieve it. The taks can be represented using a flowchart.
- 2.) Design the script; each task may be broken down into a sequence of steps. When you're ready to code the script, each step can then be translated into individual lines of code.
- 3.) Code each step

## Expressions:
- evaluates into a single value. There are two types of expression;
- expressions that just assign a value to a variable. var color = 'beige'; the value of the color is now beige.
- expressions that use two or more value to return a single value. var area = 3 * 2; the value of area is now 6.

## Operators:
- expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
- _Assignment operators:_ assign a value to a variable. color = 'beige';value of the color is now beige.
- _Arithmetic operators:_ perform basic math. area = 3 * 2; value of area is now 6.
- _String operators:_ combine two strings. greeting = 'Hi ' + 'Molly'; value of greeting is now Hi Molly.
- _Comparison Operators:_ compare two values and return true or false. buy = 3 > 5; value of buy is false.
- _Logical operators:_ combine expressions and return true or false. buy = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); value of buy is now true.

## Arithmetic Operators
- Addition: +
- Subrtraction: -
- Division: /
- Multiplication: *
- Increment: ++ adds one to the current number
- Decrement: -- subtracts one from the current number
- Modulus: % divides the two values and returns the remainder
- **Multiplication and division happen _before_ addition and subtraction**
- Concatenation; the process of joining two or more strings to create one new string.

## Functions
- functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. 
- When you ask it to perform its task, its known as *calling* the function
- Pieces of info passed to a function are known as _parameters_
- When you write a function and expect it to provide you an answer, the response is known as _return value_
- **Functional Declaration:** give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve it's task inside the curly braces.
- **Calling the Function:** having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between it's curly braces with just one line of code.
- **Parameters:** sometimes a function needs specific info to perform its task. When you declare the function you give it this.
