# Stacks and Queues
- Stacks: Last on and First off or Last in and First out (lifo)
- **Methods**: 
- .Peek(): look and see if there's anything in the stack (return a node or bool)
- .Pop(): return a node or a bool, pop it off the stack, get the thing and then remove the thing. Aka processing. Iterate the stack one time
- .Push(): puts it on top of the stack
- Property: "top" reference to do something and replace the top each time something is pushed.
- top: find the top, set the next one down to be the next top and return what used to be the top
- **Queues**:
- "First in, first out"
- processing a list of things to do
- Property: "front" vs evil twin "top"
- .Enqueue(): like our "push" method
- .Dequeue(): like our "pop" method
- .Peek(): same as our other peek method
- .Back/.Rear
