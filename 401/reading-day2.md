## You Still Donâ€™t Know How to Do Unit Testing (and Your Secret is Safe with Me)

- Unit tests isolate and exercise specific units of your code. In C# you can think of a unit as a method. You can write a unit test by writing something that tests a method. It tests something specific about that method in isolation. 
- Best practices for unit testing:
- Arrange, Act, Assert
- One Assert Per Test Method
- Avoid Test Interdependence 
- Keep It Short, Sweet, and Visible
- Recognize Test Setup Pain as a Smell
- Add Them to the Build

## Art of Readme
- When creating a README your job is to tell them what it is they're looking at (with context), show them what it looks like in action, show them how they use it, tell them any other relevant details. It is up to the "module" creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.
- The lack of a README is a powerful red flag, but even a lengthy README is not indicative
