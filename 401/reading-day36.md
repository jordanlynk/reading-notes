## Xamarin : Data Services

- Xamarin.Forms code runs on multiple platforms, each of which has its own file system. 
- PCL Storage provides a consistent, portable set of local file IO APIs for .NET, Windows Phone, Windows Store, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android and Silverlight.
- Xamarin.Forms is a cross-platform UI toolkit, which allows the user to efficiently create a native user interface layout
- Add the PCLStorage Nuget package to all the projects.
- PCLStorage API will help us to retrieve all the platforms'  local folder names and paths, using the code given below. There is no need to write any platform-specific code to access the local folder.
- The SQLite database engine allows Xamarin.Forms applications to load and save data objects in shared code. 
- A database wrapper class abstracts the data access layer from the rest of the app.
