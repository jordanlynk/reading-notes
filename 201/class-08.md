# Chapter 15: "Layout"
- position-static: this is typically default within how browsers treat HTML elements, keeps it the same.
- position:relative: moves element in relation to normal flow. to move the box up or down, use top or bottom properties. to move the box horizontally, ues left or right properties. Values of box offset properties usually are given in pixels, percentages or erms.
- position-absolute: the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on page. Specifies where the element should appear in relation to it's containing element.
- position-fixed: absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed. When the user scrolls on the page, it stays in the exact same spot.
- z-index: controls which element sits on top
- float: places the element as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.
- clear: says that no element should touch the left or right hand sides of box, it can take left, right, both and none as values.
- Multi-Column Layouts W/ Floats: width, float positions the columns next to one another and margin creates a gap between columns.
- Fixed Width Layout: to create this, width of main boxes on a page will usually be specified in pixels.
- Liquid Layout: uses percentages to specify the width of each box so the design will stretch and fit the size of the screen.
