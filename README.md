My name is Jordan Kidwell, I am 25. I love all animals essentially, anything that challenges me and diving into a good book.

# Growth Mindset
Growth mindset for me is the ability to take an action and no matter what you think the outcome is going to be, push through. To never assume you're automatically going to fail. I know that there isn't always going to be an easy or clear solution to problems in life, but perseverance is what encourages me to push through and look for the greener pasture.
## Reminders for Growth Mindset
- Mistakes will help me learn and grow
-  I was born to learn and to keep learning
-   I will always strive for my personal best
