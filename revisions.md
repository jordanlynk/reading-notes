## Git

Allows you to keep version control on projects, files or folders

## Version Control
Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording your changes. You can revert a file or project to previous versions, track modifications, modify individuals or compare changes

## Types of Version Control
- **Local:** one database on your hard dish that stores changes to files
- **Centralized:** single server storing all changes and file versions that can be accessed by various clients. Streamlined the collaboration process, allows programmers to have more knowledge of activities & gave admins more control of divvying up.
- **Distributed:** address the vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes/new versions. 

- Without configuration of a default text editor, Git will use the system’s default editor–most likely Vim

- ACP= add, push, commit

- MKDIR= Make a directory
- CD= Command
- rm-rf will delete a folder, do not do this unless you are absolutley sure you want to delete.
