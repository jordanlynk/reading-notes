# How Computers Work

- _Take Input_: any info or data sent to a computer for processing
- _Store Info_: based on the information given by what device, it is stored to later be remembered
- _Process_: process outside information and sends it to the correct place to be stored/learned 
- Output The Results: what the computer sends back out based on the information it has learned/recieved

# Binary & Data

- no one directly deals with 1 & 0's head on but they play an important role and function in how we code and what we use.
- _Wires and Circuits_: carry all of the information in a computer. A computer essentially converts electricity into software, and it's this software which has become an integral part of each of our lives. 
- _Bit_: smallest piece of information a computer can store
- _Binary System_: two digits: 1 or 0
- text, images and sounds can be respresented with w/ numbers
- _A Simple Circuit_: takes an electrical signal and flips it
- _A Complicated Circuit_: takes multiple signals and combines them to give different results

# CPU, Memory, Input & Output

- _Input_: converts physical input to binary info
- _Memory_: stores said info
- _CPU_: central processing unit calculates info
- _Output_: converts computer info into physical output
- _Types of Output_: speaker outputs sound, 3D printer outputs objects to be printed, etc.

# Hardware & Software:

- _Hardware_: circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs and much more
- _Software_: applications, games, website, etc
- _CPU_: master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
- _Operating Sysyem_: master program that manages how software uses hardware of the computer
